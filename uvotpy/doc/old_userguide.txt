Introduction

Today I have started to write down some examples of how to run the 
UVOT grism spectral reduction program.The program is nearing completion, 
and I hope this will help the first testers (Yes, you are testing it), 
to get a feel for how I run it. 

Since it has been compiled from a basis of routines I wrote while 
doing the grism calibration, there are loads of things that can 
be adjusted, and some that don't work as I intended, like the 
optimal extraction. I will come to that later on (I hope not to 
forget...) ;-)

On my website I describe the grisms in much detail from the 
viewpoint of the calibration.  I suggest you browse that a bit 
if you are not yet familiar with the grism layout and performance. 

The website is http://www.mssl.ucl.ac.uk/~npmk/grism

On the website I also have a directory with tar files of the 
software:

http://www.mssl.ucl.ac.uk/~npmk/grism/uvotpy/

There are basically two type of uv grism spectra: Ones taken in the middle
of the detector (with the zeroth orders in the lower right hand corner), 
and spectra taken at a large offset to the top right hand corner which 
have no zeroth order on the detector, but have a second order which
no longer overlaps the first order. 

A third type of uv grism spectra is those taken with an offset to the top left
in order to avoid zeroth order contamination of background sources in
the clocked uv grism. The long wavelengths in the first order for 
thos spectra fall off the detector, but the second order is not 
well-separated from the first order. 

Following is an example of the extraction of two spectra, one 
near the centre of the detector, as most are, and a second one 
taken at a large offset to separate out the second order. 

The observations in the corner which allow to compare the response 
for the first and second order also allowed me to come up with a 
rough estimate of the second order based on the first order spectrum. 
This is a useful indication of second order contamination for those
spectra where the orders overlap. Currently, it is good for projecting 
the 1800-3500A response from first to second order.

In the first example I have used the command line mode; in the second 
I will run it from within iPython.


EXAMPLE 1:
  Extracting a spectrum with first order 2600A near the centre of 
  the detector det image, which has overlapping orders. 


The V grism spectra are not curved. In the UV grism spectra, there is 
some curvature of the orders below about 2200A, while the displacement 
of the first and second order is negligible.  The software includes 
a calibration of the order curvature referenced to the location of 
2600A in the first order.  

Ideally, the software finds the anchor point right smack on the spot. 
In reality, it can be off by as much as 15 pixels above or below the 
spectrum. The offset along the spectrum is less, typically I assume 
~2/3 of that across the spectrum. So the offset normal to the spectrum 
is some indication of possible error in the anchor point of the 
wavelength scale. With a dispersion of ~3.1A/pix that works out to 
~ 2*offset A.  The offset is printed at the end of the uvotgrism run.

The curvature is taken from a 2D-quadratic or bilinear approximation to 
polynomial coefficients that describe the offset normal to the overall 
dispersion direction ("y(x)", with x=0 at the anchor).  

An attempt will be made to improve the curvature fit by making small 
changes to the calibrated fit based on sections of the spectrum. This 
does not always succeed. 

Whatever the curvature of the orders is, it will be plotted. Near the 
centre of the detector, the second and third order predicted locations
can be a bit confusing since they overlap the first order. They are plotted
in Figure 2.1 that we will discuss later. 

For this example, I will use the spectrum of GSPC P177-D, A G0V star 
which is in STScI's Calspec library, and which we use for the flux 
calibration.

We need the position in decimal degrees, and the OBSID from swift.

#====Done (2011-Oct-20,01:28:49z)====

I will use the OBSID = 00056760002. 

For the data reduction we need at a minimum the attitude file 
(one of the auxiliary files) as well as the grism image 
"sw00056760002ugu_dt.img" file, and any lenticular file 
"sw00056760002u??_sk.img" if taken within a few seconds of the  
grism image. I usually grab it all from the Swift archive. 
The files should unpack on your machine in the standard swift
directory structure which includes: 

00056760002/auxil:
sw00056760002ppr.par.gz                 sw00056760002sat.fits

sw00056760002ugu_rw.img.gz

You will have to run the program from the directory with the grism data. That would 
be the 00056760002/uvot/image directory for this example. The program will locate the 
attitude file by walking through the directory tree. Alternatively, the relevant files 
can be copies to a single directory, and again, that is from where the program must be
run. The relevant files are: 

sw00056760002sat.fits     # the attitude "sat" or "pat" file.
sw00056760002ugu_dt.img   # the grism detector image file
sw00056760002uw2_dt.img   # [OPTIONAL] a lenticular file with image in w2, m2, w1, u, b, or v, 
                            taken within 10-20 sec of the grism exposure to improve 
			    the location of the anchor with the netter aspect from the 
			    lenticular file image.

The software has some internals that could be turned into an option 
to run from a directory other than that with the data, but that has 
not been put into this software version.

The grism detector image header should contain the proper keywords 
for correcting the distortion of zeroth order positions. Those are 
created as part of the aspect correction. The aspect correction keyword 
should be set to "GRASPCORR". 

A simple way to check is:

ftlist sw00056760002ugu_dt.img hk include=aspcorr

        Name               Type       Dimensions
        ----               ----       ----------
HDU 2   gu164505733I       Image      Real4(1987x2046)              

ASPCORR = 'GRASPCORR'

If not present or set, you should run the ftool uvotgraspcorr:
 
uvotgraspcorr catspec=$UVOTPY/calfiles/usnob1.spec distfile=CALDB sw00056760002ugu_dt.img

About 36 lines of keywords with the distortion coefficients, like 

A_ORDER =                    3
B_ORDER =                    3
A_1_0   =    0.000808337503837
A_2_0   =   -1.00634932413E-05
A_1_1   =   -6.05027923295E-07
A_0_2   =   -7.40281887760E-07
...

will now appear in the header.

In the program extension = 1 will mean the first extension with an image, which here is HDU 2. 

We will also need the position in decimal degrees. So we need to convert from 
15:59:13.57 +47:36:41.9 

If a point source, it is possible to do a lookup in the USNO-B1 catalog, which 
ensures that the aspect correction and the input position are from the same 
source, since the aspect correction is done against the USNO catalog in the 
catspec file I provided.

The three plots show the detector image in figure 1, the raw count data 
as a function of distance in pixels to the anchor in figure 2, 
and the rate/flux data as a function of wavelength in figure 3.

The location of the spectrum in figure 1 is indicated by a row of crosses 
which approximately are at 200A distances. The location of zeroth order 
of magnitude larger than about 17th in B as found in the USNO-B1 catalog
are shown as ellipses. In the clocked UV grism they also are show in the 
area on the detector where no zeroth orders fall due to the clocked aperture.
The user must judge from the image if a zeroth order is actually present. 
Very bright sources have an extended halo which extent is indicated by a larger
circle. Again, if nothing is visible in the image, the contamination it may 
cause to the spectrum is not present.

Figure 2 also shows a plot of the expected second order counts, which is
based on the first order counts and the second to first order response 
found when the orders separate in the right hand top corner of the detector.
Of course that assumes that the response ratio is constant over the detector.
In order to see if everything went as one would like it to, I plot in the top 
panel of the rotated spectrum a vertical line at the position of the 
anchor in the spectrum; a histogram across that shows the peak emission 
which has been used to position the curved slits. The curved slit edges are 
plotted for first, second and third orders. The position of the anchor corresponds
with the origin in the plots below for the first, second and third order.

It is useful to compare the counts in the first order at a certain pixel offset 
to those expected in the second order, in case the spectral orders overlap. It 
gives some indication of what part of the counts may be attributable to the 
second order. 

In figure 3, the count rates are given as a function of the wavelength. If the 
flux has been calculated, the flux will replace the rates. As of version 0.9.3.6 
that has not yet been implemented. However, the output files contain the 
spectrum in units of ergs cm-2 s-1 A-1 in the second extension of the main pha file.

Let me discuss the files that were created:

attcorr.asp                    # this file contains the attitude correction 
search.ub1                     # this file contains the list of stars from searching USNO-B1        
sw00056760002uw1_rw.img        # this is a fake image used to determine the anchor point
sw00056760002.gat.fits         # this is an updated attitude file; it includes a roll angle correction
sw00056760002uw1_sk.img        # this is the fake sky image used to determine the anchor point 
skyfits.out                    # this is a fileused to convert coordinates
skyfits.in                     # this is a fileused to convert coordinates of the source
detmm.txt                      # this is a fileused to convert coordinates of the source
radec.txt                      # this is a fileused to convert coordinates of zeroth orders
detpix.out                     # this is a fileused to convert coordinates of zeroth orders
sw00056760002ugu_1_pha_back.fits  # output file for the background - use with XSPEC
sw00056760002ugu_1_pha.fits       # main output file
sw00056760002ugu_1.rmf            # output response matrix file - use with XSPEC

Some of the intermediate (temporary files) will be removed automatically in a later 
software version.  

The main output file has three extensions: 
(1) an extension used by XSPEC with channel(keV), total counts, etc.
(2) an extension listing wavelength, flux, error, quality of all orders. 
(3) an extension with the extracted image.
So this is the most useful extension to use in, for example, IDL. The names of the 
columns have been kept consistent with the earlier uvotimgrism file, although 
some extra columns are going to be added for the second order, predicted second order, 
and perhaps later for the third or zeroth order. At present only the first order 
has been included.

In the case that there were lenticular filter observations present, the lenticular files
will proved the images for determining the anchor position and the fake file will not be 
needed. 




EXAMPLE 2:
     Extracting a spectrum with first order 2600A in the right hand top corner
     of the detector det image, where the second order is offset from the first order 
     and can be extracted independently
   
The spectra separate in the UV grism in the upper right hand area on the detector. I will 
show how to use the software, using one of the white dwarf calibration sources, namely 
WD1657+343. That one is tha faintest, and has hopefully no coincidence loss.      
  
I will run this from within iPython to show the basic steps to the new user of iPython. 
It has some similar capabilities to IDL but there are also significant differences. A 
good guide for an astronomer starting iPython is put out by the STScI people: get it at 
 http://stsdas.stsci.edu/perry/pydatatut.pdf

Start iPython with pylab for plotting, etc. ,and import the uvotgrism package. [I have 
gotten used to run in a black xterm with white text, since iPython uses colours that 
show up best that way for me. I'm red-green colour blind and it just does not look the 
same on a white background.]

In this case the observation was done where a lenticular and grism image were taken in the same uvot mode. 
We need to run the program uvotgrism.getSpec with parameters. The name is case sensitive (uvotgrism.getspec 
does not work).

Let's look at the parameters by entering uvotgrism.getSpec?

 Actually, I still need to update the text that now was printed out, since major 
 changes were made. The most useful line here is the automatically generated 
 "Definition" which lists all the parameters and keywords in this call. 
 
 Since we have a second order, I am going to set fit_second_ =True. That will also 
 trigger a fit of the third order. Sorry about the underscore. I may change that 
 in a later version.
 
 You see that the optimal_extraxtion=False. That is mainly because the current 
 implementation does not find a good normalisation.  

 To get output written to files, set the keyword wr_outfile=True.  If the output 
 files already exist (from a previous call), then they will only be overwritten is
 clobber=True. The name of the outputfile is based on the obsid and extension 'ext', 
 but the root of the filename can also be based on the 'outfile='myfilename' 
 keyword.
 
 The call also returns nearly every item computed, so it is important to assign 
 the result of the call to some variable. I"ll discuss unpacking the result later.
 
 It can happen that the algorithm to make a fine adjustment of the slit position 
 of the first order fails, for example due to another spectrum partially overlapping
 or a bright zeroth order. In that case, setting offsetlimit=<some number>, somewhere
 in the range -10,+10 will allow you to fix the positioning. Right now that has not
 yet been made easy to use. It is a bit of trial and error. Best is to use the 
 image in Figure 2. 
 
 If the program fails because the zeroth orders of field sources give problems, 
 setting skip_field_src=True will disable that. It also means that the positions 
 of the zeroth orders won't be plotted on the image or entered into the quality 
 flags. 
 
 I plan to add the capability to supply the anchor position detector coordinate 
 (in pixels) in the future. It may be needed for extended object. That would 
 have to imply no offset. 
 
 There are four flag for the plot output, including zoom which zooms in on figure 1.
 
 If highlight=True, contours are also plotted on the image. It depends on the 
 kind of object and field whether they are helpful or not. 
 
 
Now let's make a simple call to extract the spectra:

 In [19]: Z = uvotgrism.getSpec(ra,dec,obsid,1,fit_second_ =True, wr_outfile=True,chatter=1)
  
The results will be put in Z, as well as in the output files and plots.

Unfortunately, the program has some calls where error messages are generated when 
invalid data are run through (NaN data). Ignore those copious lines.  A summary is 
printed at the end:

the original offset of the anchor to the spectrum which can 
be used to indicate the accuracy of the wavelength scale, and 
several other parameters. Note that one line reports; updated

based on dividing the spectra in large sections and allowing 
a small adjustment.

In Figure 2 there are now four panels, including the second and third order. 
Those data were extracted from the slit regions shown on the first panel.

Depending on the size of the figure, the first panel may not fill the 
whole left-to-right range. That can be solved either by making the figure 
larger (more pixels), or restricting the y-range of the first panel.

This can be done from the command line: 

In [23]: figure(2)
Out[23]: <matplotlib.figure.Figure object at 0x102fdbc90>

In [24]: subplot(4,1,1)
Out[24]: <matplotlib.axes.AxesSubplot object at 0x104525cd0>

In [25]: ylim(30,170)
Out[25]: (30, 170)
  
Or using the zoom tool in the plot widget. However, the x-axis range has 
been set to be identical to that in the plots below so using the command 
lines works best. 

The zeros now line up with the anchor position in the image in the first 
panel. I plan to fix the x-label of that plot once I figure out how. 

Notice the zeroth orders that lie on and next to the first order at 
x ~ 100-150 pix (from the anchor position). The one on the first order 
triggers a quality flag.  However, notice that for large x the zeroth 
orders are labeled on the image but do not actually appear there. That is 
because of the clocking of the grism which blocks zeroth orders over 
part of the grism. A future version of the software will be made to 
only show zeroth orders in the area where they can occur. 

The blue curve in the second order panel is based on the first order 
counts to predict the second order. The conversion makes use of the 
dispersion relations of the first and second order. Below 1800A the 
conversion has not yet been calibrated. 

Note that close to the edge the spectrum has a peak which is not physical. 
That is actually a common occurrence near the edge, so be careful with 
data from that area. There is also a 'bump' in the second order spectrum 
in figure 3 at a pixel distance of about 420 pixels; around 2200A in 
Figure 3. It happens right where the second order slit crossed into the 
boundaries of the first order slit. Basically that means that any second 
order data beyond that point includes contamination of the first order. 


Unpacking the result.

Now you may want to plot the data your own way. How to get hold of them?

One way is to read back the outpur files. The other is to unpack the 
result in Z. I"ll explain the most salient ones:

In [26]: Y0, Y1, Y2, Y3, Y4 = Z 

The predicted second order: 
In [27]: wav2p, dis2p, flux2p, qual2p, dist12p = Y4[0]
	wav2p = wavelenght in A (array)
	dis2p = distance to 2nd order anchor in pix (array)
	dist12p = distance between first and second order anchor in pix (scalar)
	flux2p = predicted count rate (c/s) 
	qual2p = quality inherited from first order (0=good)

In case of the optimal extraction:
 In [28]: counts, variance, borderup, borderdown, (fractions,cnts,vars,newsigmas) = Y3 
 failed since we did not do optimal extraction...
 
The fit to the curvature and counts in the slits:

In [31]: fit, (coef0,coef1,coef2,coef3), (bg_zeroth,bg_first,bg_second,bg_third), (borderup,borderdown) = Y2
	bg_zeroth, etc is the background over the width of the slit
	borderup[1,:] is the upper border of the first order slit
	borderdown[1,:] is the lower border of the first order slit
	coef1 is the polynomial coefficient to use with polyval(coef,dis) to find 
	  the y-position of curvature referenced to the anchor crossing the spectrum.

In [33]: (present0,present1,present2,present3),(q0,q1,q2,q3), \
   ....:               (y0,dlim0L,dlim0U,sig0coef,sp_zeroth),(y1,dlim1L,dlim1U,sig1coef,sp_first),\
   ....:               (y2,dlim2L,dlim2U,sig2coef,sp_second),(y3,dlim3L,dlim3U,sig3coef,sp_third),\
   ....:              (x,xstart,xend,sp_all,quality)  = fit
        present? is a logical, which is true is the order could be present in the image
	   (so, present2 = True --> second order present) If, of course the is no uv flux, there 
	   is no second order to be seen.
        q1 is a list where q1[0[ is an array listing the indices of all the first order data.
	   so x[q1[0]] are the distances of all the first order data to the anchor, and 
	   polyval(C_1, x[q1[0]]) are the wavelengths, using the first order dispersion C_1.
	   y1[q1[0]] lists the y-coordinate of the curved slit at position x[q1[0]]
	   dlim1U, dlim1L are the upper and lower limits in pixel distance to the anchor of the 
	      first order spectrum (so it is to be found between those limits).
	   sig1coef is the polynomial coefficient of the width of the spectrum:
	      width = polyval(sig1coef, x[q1[0]])
	   sp_first are the counts in the first order spectrum, again at locations q1[0]
	   Similarly for the other orders. Note that the zeroth order has not been checked for 
	      ages and probably gives nonsense.       


Rotated image extraction with straight slit. 
In [32]: ( (dis,spnet,angle,anker,anker2,anker_field,ank_c), (bg,bg1,bg2,extimg,spimg,spnetimg,offset), 
   ....:            (C_1,C_2,img),  hdr,m1,m2,aa,wav1 ) = Y1

    dis = distance to the anchor in x-coordinate (negative left of the anchor)
    spnet = spectrum counts (not yet rate), for straight slit of the parameter spextwidth in the call.
    angle = angle for rotation from the calibration file
    anker = detector position first order anchor from the calibration file in pixels
    anker2 = second order anchor position
    anker_field = field coordinate (used to lookup in the calibration file)
    ank_c = (Y position anchor, X position anchor, left side, right side) of rotated extracted image.
    bg1,bg2 = background on top/bottom of the spectrum, clipped and smoothed.  bg = mean
    extimg = extracted, rotated image section (angle = 180-angle)
    spimg = extracted image
    spnetimg = spimg minus background
    offset = initial determination of offset
    C_1 = dispersion first order interpolated from calibration file by location on detector
    C_2 = dispersion second order (referenced to second order anchor)
    img = the original detector image
    hdr = the header
      get the exposure from hdr['exposure'] ; works for any keyword in the header.
      

Main parameters
In [34]: (specfile, lfilt1_, lfilt1_ext_, lfilt2_, lfilt2_ext_, attfile), (method), \
   ....:         (Xphi, Yphi, date1), (dist12, ankerimg, ZOpos) = Y0
   specfile = detector image file
   lfilt1_ = filter type of lenticular image taken close to grism exposure
   lfilt_ext = extension number for that image
   att_file = attitude file 
   dist12 = distance between first and second order anchor points
   ankerimg = anchor position on original detector image in image coordinates
   

Zeroth orders:     
In [35]: Xim,Yim,Xa,Yb,Thet,b2mag,matched,ondetector = ZOpos

   Xim, Yim = center coordinates of each zeroth order in image coordinates
   Xa, Yb = size axis in pixels along coordinates
   b2mag = USNO-B1 catalog B2 magnitude of object
   matched = logical if matched with source found on image using uvotdetect
   ondetector = False means that the source is just not falling on the detector.


I hope this helps.  In the future I plan to come with an improved version, and any suggestions/
contributions would be great to have!
