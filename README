Swift UVOT grism spectral extraction code
*******************************************

The UVOTPY code provides software to extract wavelength 
and flux calibrated spectra from Swift Ultraviolet and 
Optical Grism images. The software has been tested on 
Mac and Linux.

The Swift UVOT grism calibration has been described in

Recent calibration observations show additional loss of sensitivity below 1800A 
(that is 12 years into the mission.) Currently, 1%/year is assumed and consistent
with the red part of the spectrum. A preliminary correction for the 
UV clocked mode in the range 1700-3000A has been implemented (2017/12/30).

For detailed documentation including software setup, visit the grism calibration 
website available from: 

   http://www.mssl.ucl.ac.uk/www_astro/uvot/ 

In the current release of the software, the grism 
calibration files are included in the package, but 
require the definition of an environment variable, 

setenv UVOTPY <installation directory>

so that $UVOTPY/calfiles/ which contains the calibration 
files can be found by the software.

Please note that recent updates require the installation of the packages 
  future 
  astroquery
  
I.e, 
pip install future
pip install astroquery
